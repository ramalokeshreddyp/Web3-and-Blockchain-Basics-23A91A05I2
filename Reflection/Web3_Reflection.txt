Reflection

This Web3 Basics assignment provided me with a strong foundation in blockchain technology and hands-on experience with decentralized applications.
Initially, I learned how blockchain differs from traditional databases — blockchain stores data across distributed nodes where every transaction is immutable and transparent. Unlike centralized systems, there is no single controlling authority, which enhances trust and security.

Understanding smart contracts was fascinating. They are pieces of self-executing code that automate processes on the blockchain without human intervention. In this project, I saw how Uniswap uses smart contracts to handle token swaps securely, eliminating the need for a central exchange.

Setting up MetaMask taught me how wallets act as a bridge between users and the blockchain. I learned about seed phrases, which serve as master keys to a wallet. I ensured I stored mine offline, realizing that losing it means losing access permanently.

When requesting test ETH from the Sepolia faucet, I observed how transactions move from pending to confirmed states and how gas fees are used to reward validators.
Connecting to Uniswap and performing a swap gave me a real understanding of transaction signing — MetaMask required confirmation before executing the smart contract interaction.

The Etherscan explorer helped me view transaction details like block number, gas used, and timestamps, showing full transparency of blockchain operations.

Overall, this task helped me build confidence in Web3 fundamentals. I now understand the role of decentralization, the importance of security, and how smart contracts form the backbone of DApps. This hands-on exercise was an exciting first step toward developing real blockchain applications.
